<h1> Humor on the Web </h1>
  <h3> As presented by Sam Johnson</h3>
  <p> One might say that the internet's bland humor is the root of all problems with us young whippersnappers. And frankly that might be truer than we'd like to believe. But like a true youngster, let's just say "whatever" and forget about that for now. </p>

  <h2> Talking Animals </h2>
  <p>This is probably the oldest internet video I can remember, and it is still my favorite. I think most videos about talking animals are stale, irritating, and pretentious; one might even say they are the white bread of the internet. But one thing I know for sure is that they will <em> never </em> be funnier than this one. </p>
  <br> You can watch it <a href="https://youtu.be/wKXOLPmfr6k?si=-F7c_AsAJF36SLdk"> <b> Here. </b> </a>

  <h2> Regurgitation  </h2>
  <p>For better or worse, internet humor is often dependant on the morphing or merging or pre-existing things (typically revolving around pop culture), ranging from popularity to almost total obscurity.</p> <br>
  In my opinion, this tends to be unoriginal, uncreative, and unintellegent, but sometimes it's just inexplicably hilarious, such as <a href="https://youtu.be/-w-58hQ9dLk?si=fVqLs8zbAw0BGPnB"> <b> this video here. </b> </a>

  <h2> Diamond in the Rough </h2>
  <p> Sometimes, somewhere just beyond the trends and fads, in the incomprehensible vastness of the web, you find a small, perfect little gem. Like a solitary star in the vaccum of space, or a pirates trave, a glimmering speck waiting to be found. </p>
  <a href="https://youtu.be/KwYGI8OjXvo?si=FJpyV3YBZbUUKKuv"> <b> This </b> </a> is one of those gems.
