        <p>  A Hero is a champion, a conqueror, a knight, a paladin, a person of the hour, a protector a savior, a victor, a warrior, a white knight, a winner, an eidolon, an example, an icon, an idol, a model, a paragon, a person to look up to, a role model, a shining example <em> (and no I didn't just copy that from Thesaurus.com [well ok maybe like 90% of it, but that's not the point]). </em></p>
        <p> <strong> Heroism </strong> means self sacrifice, except for <strong> one man </strong>, who has done literally <em>everything</em> without the slightest bit of effort.  </p>
        <p> His name is known by all, he is larger than life, like Superman <em> (except actually real).</em>  He is a beacon of hope to all, the Chick-fil-a sauce of all mankind! </p>
        <p> Plus he's got a cool beard.
